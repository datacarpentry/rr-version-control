# Recording the history of your projects

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.


## Question?

<br>

## Better - Saving everything together at once

Everytime you make a save, you zip the entire directory that your project files are in and save it with a date.

## How does a version control system work?

## 

- Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save just
the changes you made at each step of the way.

- You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

## 

- You can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.
